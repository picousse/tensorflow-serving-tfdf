        TensorFlow Serving is a flexible, high-performance serving system for
        machine learning models, designed for production environments. TensorFlow
        Serving makes it easy to deploy new algorithms and experiments, while
        keeping the same server architecture and APIs. TensorFlow Serving
        provides out-of-the-box integration with TensorFlow models, but can be
        easily extended to serve other types of models and data.
